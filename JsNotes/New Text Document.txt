Convert any values to boolean
Two methods
1.Boolean();
2.!!

How !! works
first ! converts to boolean  and since default value of boolean is false,second ! is used to convert the default value(false) to true

'false' and false are not same

!!'false' is true since it is a string
!!false is false since it is a falsy value
